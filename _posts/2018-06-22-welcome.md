Welcome to the new PraxisLIVE blog, now hosted as part of a revamped website. The
[old WordPress blog](https://praxisintermedia.wordpress.com){:target="_blank"} will be left as an
archive but no new posts added - some old but still relevant information will be
updated and reposted here.

This coincides with the recent release of PraxisLIVE v4, and the restructuring and
relicensing of the [PraxisCORE runtime](/core/), which now has its own dedicated page.
Separate pages have been added for [downloads](/download/) and [community](/community/),
with links to the relatively new [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/praxis-live){:target="_blank"} and
[DonorBox donations](https://donorbox.org/praxislive){:target="_blank"}. And the documentation has been
re-hosted and given a new UI at [https://docs.praxislive.org](https://docs.praxislive.org){:target="_blank"}. 

There are lots of exciting things in the pipeline for PraxisLIVE over the summer months
so please keep an eye here for updates!
